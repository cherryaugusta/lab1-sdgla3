## Portfolio focus

The portfolio is structured to show credible engineering breadth and clear project hierarchy.

The strongest repeated evidence across the repositories includes:

- Python application engineering
- Django and Django REST Framework
- TypeScript-based frontend delivery
- React and Angular
- PostgreSQL and Redis-backed workflows
- Celery, Django Channels, and async processing
- Docker-based local reproducibility
- workflow-heavy system design
- typed frontend-backend integration
- reviewable AI-assisted workflows with auditability and evaluation-oriented patterns

## Project groups

### Flagship projects

These projects provide the strongest combined evidence across backend systems, frontend delivery, full-stack application design, workflow control, and technical reviewability.

#### Consumer Duty Evidence Engine
Repository: [consumer-duty-evidence-engine](https://github.com/cherryaugusta/consumer-duty-evidence-engine)

AI-assisted evidence review workflow for regulated-style artefacts, built around claim extraction, evidence sufficiency assessment, contradiction detection, review routing, evaluation, and audit-ready traceability.

#### Meridian Ledger
Repository: [meridian-ledger](https://github.com/cherryaugusta/meridian-ledger)

Full-stack knowledge operations platform for owner-scoped notes, asynchronous indexing, grounded retrieval-backed answers, and persisted evaluation workflows.

#### Agentic Compliance Auditor
Repository: [agentic-compliance-auditor](https://github.com/cherryaugusta/agentic-compliance-auditor)

Rules-first policy audit system for contradiction detection, drift analysis, typed findings, citations, review tasks, audit lineage, and degraded-mode visibility.

#### AI Model Governance Workbench
Repository: [ai-model-governance-workbench](https://github.com/cherryaugusta/ai-model-governance-workbench)

Internal AI governance control plane for prompt and model versioning, release candidates, evaluation gates, approvals, incidents, rollback, and audit history.

### Featured projects

These projects add further evidence across frontend architecture, full-stack workflow design, and practical Python integration.

- [Sentra Nexus](https://github.com/cherryaugusta/sentra-nexus)
- [LawPulse](https://github.com/cherryaugusta/lawpulse)
- [GreenOps](https://github.com/cherryaugusta/greenops-carbon-accounting-platform)
- [TradeFlow](https://github.com/cherryaugusta/TradeFlow)
- [Gmail MCP Server](https://github.com/cherryaugusta/gmail-mcp-server)

The Gmail MCP Server card on the Projects page uses a composite of five local screenshots showing Gmail API enablement, OAuth client configuration, Claude Desktop configuration, smoke-test verification, and local MCP server startup.

### Angular and contract-aware projects

These repositories show Angular, TypeScript, Django, OpenAPI-aware integration, and reproducible local execution as part of the wider portfolio.

- [EcoRoute LEZ Optimiser](https://github.com/cherryaugusta/EcoRoute-LEZ-Optimiser)
- [OpsSentinel](https://github.com/cherryaugusta/OpsSentinel)
- [PolicyPulse](https://github.com/cherryaugusta/policypulse)
- [FinCrime GraphOps](https://github.com/cherryaugusta/fincrime-graphops)
- [LondonPlan RAG](https://github.com/cherryaugusta/londonplan-rag)

### Supporting projects

These projects reinforce Python, analytics, and machine learning foundations.

- [Python Contacts Manager](https://github.com/cherryaugusta/python-contacts-manager)
- [Advanced Python Calculator](https://github.com/cherryaugusta/advanced-python-calculator)
- [GloBox A/B Testing Analysis](https://github.com/cherryaugusta/GloBox_A-B_Testing_Analysis)
- [Credit Card Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/cherryaugusta/Credit-Card-Customer-Segmentation)
- [Predicting Heart Disease](https://github.com/cherryaugusta/Predicting-Heart-Disease)

## Website implementation

This portfolio website is intentionally built as a static GitHub Pages site using:

- plain HTML
- plain CSS
- plain JavaScript

This keeps the site:

- zero-cost by default
- easy to maintain
- easy to inspect during review
- fast to load
- simple to update
- compatible with GitHub Pages without extra hosting services

## Important architecture distinction

This repository contains the **portfolio website**, not the runtime infrastructure for the showcased applications.

That distinction matters:

- the portfolio website itself is a static site hosted on GitHub Pages
- the showcased Django, React, Angular, Python, and workflow-heavy systems are separate project repositories
- some showcased projects represent full-stack or local-tooling architectures that require their own runtime environments beyond GitHub Pages
- the portfolio site is intentionally static so the presentation layer stays low-maintenance and reliable
