## Design and implementation notes

This portfolio is intentionally built as a static site for **GitHub Pages** using:

* plain HTML
* plain CSS
* plain JavaScript

Reasons for this approach:

* zero-cost default hosting
* low maintenance burden
* strong portability
* fast loading
* easy inspection during technical review
* no dependency on paid templates, hosted form providers, or external app hosting

Additional screenshot folders can be added later if they become part of the site.

## Accessibility and readability

The site is structured to support:

* semantic HTML
* keyboard navigation
* visible focus states
* skip link
* readable spacing
