# Professional Developer Portfolio

## Overview

This is a responsive, high-performance personal profile webpage showcasing my journey as a Software & App Developer with a foundation in Data Science. The portfolio demonstrates modern front-end architectural principles, including CSS Grid for complex layouts and Flexbox for fluid, component-based responsiveness.

The project reflects a "data-intelligent" approach, highlighting both front-end engineering skills and structured software design principles.

## Architecture & Features

- **Mobile-First Design:** Fully responsive UI using viewport meta tag and media queries.
- **Modern CSS Layouts:**
  - **CSS Grid:** Powers the "Featured Projects" section with `auto-fit` and `minmax` for flexible wrapping.
  - **Flexbox:** Used for skills categories and navigation elements to maintain alignment across screen widths.
- **Semantic HTML5:** Proper use of `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` for accessibility (A11y) and SEO.
- **Custom Design System:** Centralized CSS variables (`:root`) for theme management, ensuring consistent colors and typography.
